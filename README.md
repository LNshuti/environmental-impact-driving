# Estimate the Market Size for Electic and Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles In Africa
The goal of this repository is to use open data repositories to answer the following questions: What is the estimated market size of electric and hybrid vehicles in Africa? What is the cost effectiveness of investing in electric vehicles as a public good to clean-up the air of all major African cities? What are environmental externalities generated by the extraction of natural resources such as **Cobalt and Lithium** to supply the appetite for batteries for electric vehicles?
